# connect_four
This is a terminal version of connect four that has been done the TDD style. 

# Gist
This is a classic Connect Four in it's bare-bones implementation that has been 
done as a TDD practice for the Odin Project. The goal was to write a sufficient
amount of tests in order to be able to write the game just by passing all of
them. 

# Approach
I did not waste much time on tidying things up and did it as simply as possible. 
I've come up with a Ray system module to check for a win after player's move. 

# What Have I Learned
Rspec, Rspec and once again Rspec. Played with the syntax, learned to translate my goals into rspec and fulfil them. Quite a satisfying experience. Also Colorize Gem, love it.
